Compare your results to A.symmetric_difference(B).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nTask 6\nStudy other operations on sets.

Explain the difference between the commands intersection and intersection_update.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nTask 7\nTest in Python (with a couple of examples) the statement that the empty set is a subset of any set.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nTask 8\nBisection Method. A continuous function that changes sign in an interval \\([a, b]\\) has at least one root there. Such a root can be found by the bisection method.\nStarting from \\([a, b]\\), investigate the sign change in the subintervals \\([a, \\tfrac{a+b}{2}]\\) and \\([\\tfrac{a+b}{2}, b]\\). If the sign changes in the first subinterval, redefine \\(b := \\tfrac{a+b}{2}\\); otherwise set \\(a := \\tfrac{a+b}{2}\\). Repeat until \\(b - a\\) is less than a given tolerance. Note that a sign change is characterized by \\(f(a) f(b) &lt; 0\\).\nImplement this algorithm. It needs the initial interval \\([a, b]\\) and the tolerance. Test the method with the function \\(\\arctan(x)\\) and with the polynomial \\(f(x) = 3x^2 - 5\\) in the interval \\([-0.5, 0.6]\\) and alternatively in \\([-1.5, -0.4]\\).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."
