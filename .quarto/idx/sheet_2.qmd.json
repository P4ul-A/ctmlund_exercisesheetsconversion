The approximation is quite good, so you might want to plot the difference between the approximation and the exact solution instead.\n\n```{pyodide-python}\n#| read-only: false\nimport math\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nh = 1/1000\na = -0.5\n\ntd = [n * h for n in range(0, 1001)]\nexact = [math.exp(a * t) for t in td]\n\n# Plot exact and approximate in the same figure\nplt.plot(td, exact, label=\"Exact: exp(a t)\")\nplt.plot(td, u, label=\"Approximation u_n\")\nplt.xlabel(\"t\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Value\")\nplt.title(\"Exact vs Approximate Solution\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThe mathematical background to this problem will be taught in later courses when you become familiar with differential equations.\n\nGood luck!","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nNUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  \nMalin Christersson, Robert Klöfkorn  \n\nThe purpose of this training assignment is to work with lists and `for` loops.  \nYou should start working on these exercises during the scheduled computer lab hours and complete them on your own at home.\n\nThis assignment has 14 tasks.\n\n## Warming-up Exercises\n\n### Task 1\n\nRead the debugging documentation for Spyder:  \n<https://docs.spyder-ide.org/5/panes/debugging.html>  \n\nWhile you are there, check for other interesting topics that you want to know about your editor.  \nIf you are using a different editor, then find out how to do debugging in your editor.\n\n### Task 2\n\nImplement the following `for` loop and inspect each iteration with the debugger.\n\n```{pyodide-python}\n#| read-only: false\nx = 0.5  # x_0\nfor i in range(200):\n    x = x**2  # x_i\nprint(f\"The result after {i+1} iterations is {x}\")\n```\n\nNote: For $x_0 < 1$ the above iteration is called a fixed point iteration, because for all starting values $x_0 < 1$ this will converge to $0$.
