Set up a function that evaluates $f$ and plot it for a fixed value of $r$. Note: the real part of a complex variable $z$ is `z.real` and the imaginary part is `z.imag`. The imaginary unit $i$ is written as `1j` in Python.\n\nThen let $r$ vary from 0.1 to 1.0 and plot the corresponding concentric circles.
