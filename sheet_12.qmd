NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

This exercise demonstrates the use of matplotlib's GUI and continues Training Exercise 11.  
This assignment has 4 tasks.

Solutions: [Sheet 12 Solutions](sheet_12_solutions.qmd)

## Warming-up Exercises

### Task 1

Consult the matplotlib documentation: <https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/>.  
Obtain the code for the Axes Demo and run it. While there also look at other
examples you find interesting.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: obtain and run the Axes Demo example.
```

### Task 2

Obtain the code for one of the 3D plotting examples from the book Chapter 6 -
Plotting and run it. Compare with the 3D plotting examples that you find on the
matplotlib documentation page.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: obtain and run a 3D plotting example from the book.
```

## Exercises

### Task 3

Consider the function $\sin(\omega x)$ and its second degree Taylor polynomial
when expanded about a given point $x_0$. The aim of this task is to study the
change of the Taylor polynomials in dependence of $x_0$ and $\omega$. Modify
your code of Assignment 11, so that it plots the function and its Taylor polynomial
when $x_0$ and $\omega$ are given. Plot these two functions over the interval
$[0, 2\pi]$ in the way you plotted them in Training Assignment 11, Task 2 and 3.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: plot sin(omega x) and its Taylor polynomial for given x0 and omega.
```

### Task 4

Design and program a GUI which serves as a user friendly way to input
interactively the two parameters $x_0$ and $\omega$ to fast and easily vary the
curves to demonstrate their dependency on these parameters. Equip the GUI with
all necessary text to make your program a good demonstration tool for Taylor's
theorem.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: build a GUI to vary x0 and omega interactively.
```
