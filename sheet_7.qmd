NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Claus Fuhrer, Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

This assignment has 3 tasks.

Solutions: [Sheet 7 Solutions](sheet_7_solutions.qmd)

## Exercises

For these tasks you need knowledge about vectors and arrays, Chapter 4/5 in the
course book.

### Task 1

A central theorem in linear algebra says that the eigenvalues of real symmetric
matrices are real and that their eigenvectors are orthogonal. Try to verify this
theorem by using square random matrices of dimensions not less than 5.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: verify the theorem for random symmetric matrices of size >= 5.
```

### Task 2

Given a vector $u \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Construct a $n \times n$ matrix $A$ with the
properties

$$
A_{i,i} = -2 u_i,\quad i = 1, \dots, n,
$$

$$
A_{i+1,i} = u_i,\quad i = 1, \dots, n-1,
$$

$$
A_{i,i+1} = u_{i+1},\quad i = 1, \dots, n-1,
$$

and all other elements being zero.

Do this task by using the NumPy command `diag` and alternatively by using
for-loops. Write a function that takes a vector and returns such a matrix.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: build the matrix using np.diag and for-loops.
```

### Task 3

Call the function you created in the last task with

```
u = linspace(0, 2 * pi, 500)
```

as input to get a matrix $D$. Compute the matrix $\sin(D)$. Multiply this matrix
with the one-vector (a vector filled with 1's) and plot the result versus $u$.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: compute sin(D) * ones and plot the result versus u.
```
