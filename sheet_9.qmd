NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

In this exercise we study inheritance of classes.  
This assignment has 4 tasks.

Solutions: [Sheet 9 Solutions](sheet_9_solutions.qmd)

## Tasks

### Task 1

Define an abstract class `PolyGon`. It should have a method `plot` which plots
the polygon by drawing its edges. It should also have an `__init__` method, which
takes a list of corner points as input. Corner points are described by arrays with
shape `(2,)` describing the coordinates of the corners. The `__init__` method
assigns this corner list as an attribute and also computes the edges.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: define the PolyGon abstract class with __init__ and plot.
```

### Task 2

Define a class `Rectangle` which inherits as much as possible from the parent
class `PolyGon`. Provide it also with a method to compute the area.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: define Rectangle inheriting from PolyGon and add an area method.
```

### Task 3

Define a third class `SpecialRectangle` which describes rectangles which have all
its edges parallel to the coordinate axes. It should be constructed by inheritance
from the class `Rectangle`.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: define SpecialRectangle inheriting from Rectangle.
```

### Task 4

Give this class a method `__contains__` such that for two given `SpecialRectangle`s
`A` and `B` the statement `A in B` evaluates to `True` if `A` is contained in `B`
and `False` otherwise.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement __contains__ for SpecialRectangle.
```
