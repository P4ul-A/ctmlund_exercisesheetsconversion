NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

This assignment has 8 tasks.

Solutions: [Sheet 5 Solutions](sheet_5_solutions.qmd)

## Warming-up Exercises

Consult the lecture notes for solutions to the warming-up exercises.

### Task 1

Write a function that implements the polynomial

$$
p(x) = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d.
$$

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement the polynomial p(x) = a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d.
```

### Task 2

Rewrite your polynomial from the previous task such that the coefficients are
represented by a list (of length 4).

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement the polynomial using a list of coefficients.
```

### Task 3

Discuss with your colleagues how to use packing/unpacking techniques to use
a list as input for the polynomial from the first task.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: discuss and test packing/unpacking with your polynomial function.
```

### Task 4

Rewrite your polynomial such that arbitrary polynomials can be represented, i.e.
lists of coefficients of arbitrary length.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement a general polynomial for an arbitrary coefficient list.
```

## Exercises

### Task 5 - Integrals

Compute approximately the integral

$$
\int_0^{\pi/2} \sin(\omega x)\,dx
$$

for $\omega = 2\pi$.

For this end run at the beginning of your program the import statement

```
from scipy.integrate import quad
```

The method to integrate a function $f$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is `quad(f, a, b)`.
It returns a tuple with the approximated solution and the estimated error.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: compute the integral using quad and report the result and error.
```

### Task 6 - Integrals and plots

Compute the integral above for 1000 equidistant values of $\omega$ in the interval
$[0, 2\pi]$ and plot the results versus $\omega$.
Label the axes and add a title to the plot.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: compute the integral for many omega values and plot the results.
```

### Task 7 - Zeros of a function

Use `scipy.optimize.fsolve` to compute the positive zero of the polynomial
$p(x) = x^2 + x - 3$. Use your implemented polynomial with the appropriate
coefficients.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: use fsolve to compute the positive root of x^2 + x - 3.
```

### Task 8 - Zeros of a parameter dependent function

Plot the positive zeros of the polynomials

$$
p(x) = a x^2 + x - 3
$$

for $a \in [1, 5]$ versus $a$.
Do the zeros depend linearly on $a$?

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: compute and plot positive roots versus a in [1, 5].
```
