NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

This exercise trains knowledge about vectors and arrays, i.e. the basics from
Chapter 4 and 5 in the course book.  
This assignment has 8 tasks.

Solutions: [Sheet 6 Solutions](sheet_6_solutions.qmd)

## Warming-up Exercises

### Task 1

Read Chapter 4 of the course book.

### Task 2

Implement the following code.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
from numpy import *

v = array([1., 2., 3])
M = array([[1., 2, 3.],
           [4., 5., 6],
           [7., 8., 9]])
# what does this line do?
z = M @ v
print(z)
```

## Exercises

### Task 3

Consider a square matrix $A$ (number of rows is the same as columns).

$A$ is symmetric if and only if $A = A^T$, i.e. if $a_{ij} = a_{ji}$ for indices
$i, j$. Accordingly, $A$ is skew-symmetric if and only if $-A = A^T$.

Write a function that takes a matrix as parameter. It should check if this matrix
is symmetric. The function should return `1` for a symmetric matrix, `-1` for a
skew-symmetric matrix and `0` otherwise. Test your function.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement and test a symmetry check for a square matrix.
```

### Task 4

Write a function that takes two vectors as parameters. It should check if these
vectors are orthogonal. If they are orthogonal it should return `True`, otherwise
`False`.

Do not forget to provide your function with a docstring.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement and test an orthogonality check for two vectors.
```

### Task 5

Write a function that takes a vector as parameter and returns the corresponding
normalized vector, i.e. $x / \lVert x \rVert$.

Write two variants of this program: one in which you compute the norm (use the
2-norm) of the vector by yourself and another which uses the function `norm`
from the module `numpy.linalg`.

Recall that to be able to use NumPy's norm function you must have the line
`from numpy.linalg import norm` at the start of your program. Note that you
cannot then call your own function `norm` too. If this is inconvenient, use
`from numpy.linalg import norm as npnorm` to give NumPy's norm function a new name.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement two normalization variants (manual norm and numpy.linalg.norm).
```

### Task 6

Show experimentally that the inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose.

Hint: $B$ is the inverse of $A$ if $AB = BA = I$, the identity matrix.
In 2D, a rotation matrix has the form

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \alpha & \sin \alpha \\
-\sin \alpha & \cos \alpha
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $\alpha$ can be any angle.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: verify experimentally that R^{-1} = R^T for rotation matrices.
```

### Extra Task 7 (in case you want an extra challenge)

(If you do not know eigenvalues yet, skip this task for now.)
Construct a $20 \times 20$ matrix with the value 4 on its diagonal and the value 1
on its sub- and super-diagonal. The rest of the matrix is zero.
Compute its eigenvalues. (Use the function `eig` from the module `numpy.linalg`.)
You might also want to check the function `diag` for this task.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: build the tridiagonal matrix and compute its eigenvalues.
```

### Extra Task 8 (in case you want an extra challenge)

(If you do not know eigenvalues yet, skip this task for now.)
Change the matrix in the above task in such a way that all the elements of its
subdiagonal instead have the value $-1$. How are the eigenvalues affected by
this change?

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: modify the subdiagonal to -1 and compare eigenvalues.
```
