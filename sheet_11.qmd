NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

The purpose of this training exercise is to work with object oriented techniques in plotting.  
This assignment has 11 tasks.

Solutions: [Sheet 11 Solutions](sheet_11_solutions.qmd)

## Warming-up Exercises

### Task 1

Obtain the mandelbrot function code from the course book Chapter 6 - Plotting
and create the same plot as in the book. While there glance through the chapter.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: obtain the mandelbrot example and reproduce the plot.
```

### Task 2

Change the color map for the plot. Potential color maps can be obtained by

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
from matplotlib import colormaps
print(colormaps)
```

## Exercises

We imagine that we are in a teaching situation and want to demonstrate properties
of a polynomial.

### Task 3

Choose a polynomial of degree 3 and plot it together with its first derivative.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: choose a cubic polynomial and plot it with its derivative.
```

### Task 4

Plot a tangent segment to this curve at its inflection point(s).

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add a tangent segment at the inflection point(s).
```

### Task 5

Do the same for its extremal values.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add tangents at the extrema.
```

### Task 6

Make the tangents a small, black, dotted line.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: set the tangent line style to dotted black.
```

### Task 7

Make the polynomial curve thicker than its derivative.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: adjust line widths.
```

### Task 8

Add annotations.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add annotations to highlight key points.
```

### Task 9

Put only the x and y coordinate of these points as tick labels.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: set custom tick labels.
```

### Task 10

Give the figure a title.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add a title.
```

### Task 11

Save it as a png file.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: save the figure as a PNG file.
```
