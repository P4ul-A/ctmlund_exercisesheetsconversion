NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

In this exercise we work with tests, both unit tests and pytest.  
This assignment has 6 tasks.

Solutions: [Sheet 13 Solutions](sheet_13_solutions.qmd)

## Tasks

### Task 1

Implement a function `crazzyPlus(a, b)` which sums two integers in a way as
described in the figure a friend found in a newspaper a while ago. Decide for
which range of arguments `a, b` you want to design your function. Raise a
`ValueError` if your function is called with wrong arguments.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement crazzyPlus(a, b) and validate inputs.
```

### Task 2

What is the time complexity of the algorithm that you designed?

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: analyze and note the time complexity of your algorithm.
```

### Task 3

Design and write tests for this function. Either use `unittest` or `pytest` for this.
You should test:

- The correct result for several test cases
- That the exception is raised, when wrong arguments are used.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: write tests for crazzyPlus using unittest or pytest.
```

### Task 4

Use the command `%timeit` and `%%timeit` to obtain some timings about the code
that you wrote. Profile your program using the `%lprun` command in the IPython
shell. Consult the lecture slides for explanation about `%lprun`.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: time and profile your implementation.
```

### Extra Task 5 (in case you want an extra challenge)

You are given an array of `N` random positive integers, i.e. $i \in \mathbb{N}$.
Find the smallest positive number missing from the array. The expected time
complexity is $O(N)$. Check that your implementation fulfills this.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement and test an O(N) solution.
```

### Extra Task 6 (in case you want an extra challenge)

Create an $n \times m$ matrix randomly filled with the values 0 or 1. Imagine that
0 stands for water and 1 means land. Find the number of islands. An island is
either surrounded by water or at the boundary of the matrix and is formed by
connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically or diagonally, i.e., in all
8 directions. Write a code that can find all islands given in a domain (matrix).
The expected time complexity is $O(n m)$. Experimentally check that your
implementation fulfills this.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: implement an O(n*m) island counter.
```
