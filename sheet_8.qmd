NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

In this exercise we define some classes to start to become familiar with the
principle syntax and methods.  
This assignment has 10 tasks.

Solutions: [Sheet 8 Solutions](sheet_8_solutions.qmd)

## Warming-up Exercises

### Task 1

Read Chapter 8 of the course book.

### Task 2

Obtain the `RationalNumber` example for the lecture and add a method for
subtraction. Use the operator `__sub__`.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: obtain the RationalNumber example and add __sub__.
```

---

## Exercises

### Task 3

Define a class `ComplexNumber` and write an appropriate `__init__` method.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: define ComplexNumber and its __init__ method.
```

### Task 4

Write a method which returns the complex number's real part, and one which
returns the imaginary part.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add methods that return the real and imaginary parts.
```

### Task 5

Write methods `is_imaginary` and `is_real`. They should return Boolean answers.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add is_real and is_imaginary methods.
```

### Task 6

Write a representation method which represents a complex number in the
mathematical notation $a + i b$.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add a __repr__ method returning "a + i b".
```

### Task 7

Write a method which returns the complex number's argument and absolute value.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add methods for argument and modulus.
```

### Task 8

Write a method which checks if two complex numbers are equal.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add an equality check for ComplexNumber.
```

### Task 9

Define methods for operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division and power of complex numbers. These methods should work also for
operations between complex numbers, integers and real numbers (floats). Where
appropriate, make sure that the result is independent of the order of the
arguments.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: add arithmetic methods for ComplexNumber.
```

### Task 10

Test your implementation by comparing to the Python native complex
implementation.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: test your ComplexNumber implementation against Python's complex type.
```
