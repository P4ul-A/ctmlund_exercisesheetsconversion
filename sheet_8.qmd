NUMA01: Computational Programming with Python  
Malin Christersson, Robert Klofkorn  

In this exercise we define some classes to start to become familiar with the
principle syntax and methods.  
This assignment has 10 tasks.

## Warming-up Exercises

### Task 1

Read Chapter 8 of the course book.

### Task 2

Obtain the `RationalNumber` example for the lecture and add a method for
subtraction. Use the operator `__sub__`.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: paste the RationalNumber class from the lecture notes here.
class RationalNumber:
    def __init__(self, numerator, denominator=1):
        # TODO: store numerator and denominator.
        pass

    def __sub__(self, other):
        # TODO: implement subtraction for RationalNumber.
        pass
```

## Exercises

### Task 3

Define a class `ComplexNumber` and write an appropriate `__init__` method.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
class ComplexNumber:
    def __init__(self, real=0.0, imag=0.0):
        # TODO: store the real and imaginary parts.
        pass
```

### Task 4

Write a method which returns the complex number's real part, and one which
returns the imaginary part.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
class ComplexNumber:
    # TODO: add the __init__ method from Task 3.

    def real_part(self):
        """Return the real part."""
        pass

    def imag_part(self):
        """Return the imaginary part."""
        pass
```

### Task 5

Write methods `is_imaginary` and `is_real`. They should return Boolean answers.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
class ComplexNumber:
    # TODO: add the __init__ method from Task 3.

    def is_real(self):
        """Return True if the imaginary part is zero."""
        pass

    def is_imaginary(self):
        """Return True if the real part is zero."""
        pass
```

### Task 6

Write a representation method which represents a complex number in the
mathematical notation $a + i b$.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
class ComplexNumber:
    # TODO: add the __init__ method from Task 3.

    def __repr__(self):
        # TODO: return a string of the form "a + i b".
        pass
```

### Task 7

Write a method which returns the complex number's argument and absolute value.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
import math

class ComplexNumber:
    # TODO: add the __init__ method from Task 3.

    def argument(self):
        """Return the argument (angle) of the complex number."""
        pass

    def modulus(self):
        """Return the absolute value of the complex number."""
        pass
```

### Task 8

Write a method which checks if two complex numbers are equal.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
class ComplexNumber:
    # TODO: add the __init__ method from Task 3.

    def __eq__(self, other):
        # TODO: implement equality check.
        pass
```

### Task 9

Define methods for operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division and power of complex numbers. These methods should work also for
operations between complex numbers, integers and real numbers (floats). Where
appropriate, make sure that the result is independent of the order of the
arguments.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
class ComplexNumber:
    # TODO: add the __init__ method from Task 3.

    def __add__(self, other):
        pass

    def __radd__(self, other):
        pass

    def __sub__(self, other):
        pass

    def __rsub__(self, other):
        pass

    def __mul__(self, other):
        pass

    def __rmul__(self, other):
        pass

    def __truediv__(self, other):
        pass

    def __rtruediv__(self, other):
        pass

    def __pow__(self, power):
        pass
```

### Task 10

Test your implementation by comparing to the Python native complex
implementation.

```{pyodide-python}
#| read-only: false
# TODO: create ComplexNumber instances and compare with Python complex numbers.
```
